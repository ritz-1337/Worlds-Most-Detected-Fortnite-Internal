# Worlds-Most-Detected-Fortnite-Internal

A basic fortnite internal base that I made in a few hours thats been sitting on my pc for months with no use. 
Made it cuz I wanted to make a fun rage internal that wasn't restrained by detectability.
Never got around to actually making anything with it so ur turn to, post in the issues tab what u make out of it.
Happy Pasting (:

note: after a quick code review by my current self I determained my old self was on the right track but still missing key elements to good code. boo hoo to me ):
